      "1. Examine the PowerShell commandline to understand what commands were executed. Note: the script may need to be decoded if it is base64-encoded.  2. Search the script for more indicators to investigate - for example IP addresses (potential C&C servers), target computers etc.  3. Explore the timeline of this and other related machines for additional suspect activities around the time of the alert.  4. Look for the process that invoked this PowerShell run and their origin. Consider submitting any suspect files in the chain for deep analysis for detailed behavior information."
